# Keyhan_VPN
t should be noted that this design is my first professional and serious design. In this project, which was done for the purpose of my internship project at Payam Pardaz company, I designed a corporate VPN. In the cosmos, simplicity and comprehensibility are the priority. Animating the icons was my hardest challenge. Keyhan design was just a serious exercise intended for me by my employer and its similarity to HotspotSheild VPN is just a trick for me.
